Assignment 1:

The program creates the folder "Welcome", if it does not exist.
Then, creates the folder "To", if it doesn't already exist. This folder is created under the folder "welcome".
The program then successfully opens a file called "OS2018" in "write-only" mode inside "To"
folder, or creates a new file in such name if it does not exist, and truncates (shortens) 
it to length 0.
Now, the program then points a pointer to the "OS2018" file.
The program writes the following lines to the file:
		(user name, in our case - chen_by)
		If you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!
		(user input, in our case - "good luck") 

The program then closes the file "OS2018".
It deletes the file "OS2018".
Then, it deletes the folder "To".
Then, it deletes the folder "Welcome".
Finally, it terminates all threads in the calling process's thread group, and finishes.
